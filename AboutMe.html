        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is <em>Carl Jesreal D. Andaya</em>, a first year student taking up <b>BSIT</b> at the of <strong>University of Cebu</strong>. This essay reflects one of the most crucial decisions I made in life, choosing the program I would pursue in college. I grew up in a family of five, but in 2017, my parents adopted a baby who is now my younger brother. Growing up, I lived in an area where technology wasn’t very common. Despite the limited access to smartphones and computers, I was interested by the idea of technology and remained persistent in learning about it. Back in elementary school, whenever I saw my teachers using their smartphones, my eyes would focus on what they were doing, feeding my curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>As I grew older, my interest in technology began to disapear as I discovered new interests. One of these was Home Economics, where I enjoyed activities like food preparation and kitchen work. I found joy in this kind of field, but my father has shown signs of disapproval from pursuing it, saying it was a job suited for “maids” or “helpers.” Over time, I came to realize that my father may have been right in a practical sense. While I enjoyed it, the rewards of such a career might not be enough to compensate for the hard labor it required. When the time came to choose my senior high school strand, I was first drawn to Home Economics (H.E) but reconsidered. For the sake of aligning my path with a better future, I decided to take the ICT strand instead because it might give me a better chance in finishing an IT course when i am in college as many of my relatives has told me that field would give me many opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>When I finally entered college, I was still having thoughts between my original interests and the opportunities that i might have. After sometime, I finally decided to choose BSIT, believing that this program would provide me more chances of a stable and rewarding career. I understood it would not be easy, but I also believed that when it comes to learning new things it always depend on the person, one may be willing to learn and study, and one doesn't and stays ignorant. Many people and relatives have said that pursuing a career in that kind of field requires effort and determination, but it also offers valuable rewards. With this mindset, I continue to go toward completing my course, hopeful that it will open doors to a better life.
